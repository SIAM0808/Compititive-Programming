finding gcd of all elements in an array:
accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), v[0], gcd<int, int>);


### the XOR operation between all elements of even length twice is equal to zero
### XOR between same number is equal to zero

### longest continious increasing divisors of a number is the x - 1, where x is the smallest number that does not divide [e.g. 1....x]
